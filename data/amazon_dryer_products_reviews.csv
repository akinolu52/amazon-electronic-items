I like the hair curler wand part the most because it's so easy to get some loose curls with it. I recommend this."

I am shocked at how hard this little thing blows air.  My hair is dry in half the time but then again,  I have thin fine hair so it doesn't take very long.  Still,  this guy does it in half the time that it takes my older blow dryers.I've used all the attachments and I have to say I don't think they're ideal for my type of hair.  As stated above,  it's fine and thin and also shoulder length so not very long.  Although I was able to use the brush attachments it was difficult getting all my strays to cooperate.  I'm from an older generation so the curler attachment was difficult for me to get used to.  It's a great unit,  for sure because my niece used it on her beautiful luscious hair and the attachments worked great.  Her hair looked amazing.One thing I'm not crazy about is when using it as a curling iron or any attachment you have to hold it from the top part or it will fold while you're using it.  You have to remember,  it's a blow dryer,  it folds into the shape of a blow dryer.  So,  having a long barrel and having to hold it from the top half while using the attachments might take some getting used to."

It’s fast, it doesn’t feel burning hot on the top setting and most of all it’s lightweight. This hair dryer has made drying my hair so much easier. I highly recommend, especially if you struggle physically to dry your hair.Original review: I have difficulty holding up a traditional hair dryer so I’ve been looking for a lightweight one to use as my regular hair dryer and was very excited to give this one a go.This hair dryer is very light and weighs less than a pound. All the attachments are magnetic and allow you to rotate them to the direction you want or easily switch between attachments and the back filter cover is also magnetic. The two buttons at the side of the handle control the temperature and the speed, the button inside is to switch to cool and the switch on the front turns it on and off. There are 4 temperature settings including cool shot and 3 speeds. It comes with a really long cord, which is wonderful, so it’s easy to move around and do other things while drying. The placement of the buttons on the side is a little annoying as it’s easy to accidentally switch the settings but it only takes a second to fix.I have a lot of very fine wavy hair that I usually blow dry straight. This hairdryer is very powerful and I find that if I use it on the highest setting it blows around my hair too much (even with the straightening attachment) and if I blow dry my hair upside down it makes it enormous and frizzy. I tend to use the two higher heat settings but on the second speed setting and that seems to work best for my hair.. Probably my favourite feature is that you don’t feel the heat with this hairdryer the way you normally would and I find it much more tolerable. I tend to only do curly hair in the summer so I haven’t had a chance to try the diffuser yet but I’m concerned it won’t work with my hair given the frizz and volume it creates when using it upside down but it might work on the lowest speed setting.I really like this hair dryer as it’s lightweight, dries my hair very fast, and it doesn’t get overly hot when using. I do have to be careful how I use it with my fine hair otherwise it ends up a giant frizzy mess, but if I get it right it does a really good quick job."

Now, now, before you stop reading, let me explain my reasoning. I have 4 dogs that need extensive grooming time after each bath, and it takes ages to even get them to the drying table. So, for sanity's sake, I need to shorten drying time as much as possible. I even have a whole enclosed basement setup with 2 fans, an air heater and my old Conair hair dryer. This summer I was getting very frustrated with just how slow it is to get my doggos dry and how frizzled my double coated terrier/poodle gets no matter what I spray on him. I was looking for a more powerful dryer that could help us in our impending time of need....dreaded snowy slushy winter. So, when I saw this Faszin ionic hair dryer for a demo on Vine, I grabbed it in a millisecond. I used this dryer twice on each of my dogs, and once on myself for a total of 9 occasions and 5.5 hrs. Here are my thoughts:-Favourite must have feature: self cleaning filter. The intake on this dryer is at the back of the unit. You first remove the magnetic perforated protector to get at the inner filter. Then you press a button to blow air in reverse out of the filter, and voila! all that dog undercoat and dander that gets caught by the intake filter screen gets blown out. This useful feature will maintain performance and extend the life of the hair dryer.-This dryer has performed non-stop in all the sessions. I am using it at high speed and on cool or sometimes low heat. The highest setting is really fast, which helps part the curly hair on the poodles and get air circulating close to the skin. The air flow is stable and I feel no overheating.-This dryer is low noise even at high power, very much a plus when using it for extended periods of time and working on dogs.-This dryer is pretty lightweight for its size and power, I really appreciate my arms not getting tired from all the maneuvering I have to do. My older Conair dryer was a much heavier unit, using this Faszin dryer feels almost like handling a toy.-My frizzy beast was tamed, well almost. He still needs a spritz at the end, but I did notice considerably less overall frizz. I take this as a win.-The biggest impact this dryer brings is cutting the total drying time in 1/2. Each dog used to take me on average 1 hour to dry, now the average has dropped to 35 minutes.Overall, I recommend this dryer for a thick and full head of human hair and of course, for dogs with dense or long coats. It is mighty expensive so I hope my experience with it gives you insight into its value. You get what you pay for with this one."

This works well, enough for a portable travel friendly hair dryer. Add about 3 pounds it is easy to use by right and left hand, and the airflow is fast and furious at 1600 watts  not quiet but the sound is from the air coming out not the motor , doesn't get hot in the hand accept the front tip . Attachments are easy too put on take off they have magnets. Dries fast without damaging, I don't have to flat iron as much.TIPS:-for maintenance, clean the filter with a dry cloth, or a handheld vacuum to remove residue and prevent clogs in the airflow, I don't wrap the calls around the device I wrap them separately and and use a hair tie to secure. Extra hair products post wash, create build up and reduce efficiency of drying, increasing drying time. great for sharing with friends- so many settings different- but style your hair first- you may never get it back . Sharing is caring, I ❤ to share my trials. Hope this helps ✌"

You can adjust the speed as well as the temperatures. It is very lightweight which is great if you are awake or have disabilities that make it hard to hold things up.
